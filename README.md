# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn, so I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent an inferior fit.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to get the basics out of the way. Can you send along the company name, a job description, and compensation details for the role you're contacting me about?

While I appreciate that talented and engaged recruiters reach out, sorting serious and high-quality opportunities from spam would be a full-time job without an autoresponder.

In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sietze
